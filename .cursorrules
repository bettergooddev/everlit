# You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind.

# Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

# Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

# TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

# GraphQL Usage
- Use GraphQL for data fetching of Strapi and Saleor API.
- Only query the fields that are needed.
- Use Facebook Relay and relay-compiler for type-safe GraphQL queries and mutations.
- Co-align queries, mutations, and fragments within the same file as the component.
- Use fragments in components to enhance modularity and reuse.

# Example Structure:
# src/components/UserComponent.tsx  # Contains component, queries, and mutations

# Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

# UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

# Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

# Key Conventions
<!-- - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management. -->
- Use 'react-hook-form' and 'zod' for forms and validation.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
  - Use only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.

# Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.

# Relay Cursors Rules
# 1. Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names and camelCase for GraphQL variables.
- Suffix queries with "Query", mutations with "Mutation", and fragments with "Fragment".

# 2. Query and Mutation Co-alignment
- Place queries, mutations, and fragments in the same file as the component.
- Organize files in a clear directory structure.

# 3. Use Fragments for Data Fetching
- Use Relay fragments within the component to specify needed fields.

# Example:
# const userFragment = graphql`
#   fragment UserComponent_user on User {
#     id
#     name
#     email
#   }
# `;

# 4. Centralized GraphQL Schema
- Keep a centralized schema file (e.g., `src/data/schema.graphql`) for type generation.

# 5. TypeScript Integration
- Define component props and GraphQL types with TypeScript for type safety.

# 6. Error Handling
- Handle errors in components and provide user feedback using the `error` property from Relay hooks.

# 7. Optimize for Performance
- Use Relay’s pagination and connection APIs for large datasets.

# Example:
# const { data, error } = useQuery(graphql`...`);

# 8. Documentation
- Document queries and mutations with comments for clarity and future reference.

# Framer Motion
- Framer Motion is now just called motion, its npm package is now `npm i motion` rather than `npm i framer-motion`. Its import is similarly `import from motion`


# Typography
- Do not use standard tailwind size classes such as text-sm, text-base, and so on. 
- If found in the globals.css file, then use instead the convention `type-*` 
- Ex. type-h1, type-h2, ..., type-body, type-caption, etc. 
- The type classes are @utility definitions.  This means they can and often include multiple properties each via @apply. These include properties like font, and weight, and others which you may find while inspecting globals.css.  As such, do not define those either in place of these new classes.

# Glow Components
- Create separate components: GlowDesktop, GlowMobile, GlowTablet (all accept className and backgroundImage props).
- Dedicated glow.tsx file in the same directory as the block/hero component.
- Configure `backgroundImage` field in block/hero config/fields as upload type with `relationTo: 'media'` (see `src/blocks/CaseStudies/config.ts`, `src/heros/Sub/fields.ts`).
- Glow components accept `backgroundImage: string | MediaType | null | undefined` prop and check `if (!backgroundImage) return null` before rendering.
- External div wrapper with `pointer-events-none absolute inset-0 overflow-hidden -my-[28rem]` for overflow containment and negative margin (no longer needed on Section or parent wrapper).
- Placement config (right, top, left, width, height, etc.) defined in motion.div initial/animate props.
- Breakpoint visibility handled in parent component via className (e.g., `hidden lg:block`, `hidden md:block lg:hidden`, `md:hidden`).
- Dev mode: Comment out animated rotation/translation blocks; use `animate` with static positioning (opacity: 1, no transitions).
- Prod mode: Uncomment animated rotation/translation; use `initial` with opacity: 0, then `animate` to opacity: 1 with continuous rotateY/translateY/translateX animations and transitions.
- Reference implementations: `src/blocks/CaseStudies/glow.tsx`, `src/heros/Sub/glow.tsx`, `src/heros/Sub/index.tsx`, `src/blocks/CaseStudies/client.tsx`
